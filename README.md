# Spring Testcontainers

This project illustrates how to utilize Testcontainers in a Spring Boot project
and what some potential use cases may look like.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed:
- JDK 11 (newer versions are likely but not guaranteed to work)
- Docker (the Docker daemon must be running for tests using Testcontainers)

#### How to Run

Tests

```
$ ./gradlew test
```

Run app locally in Docker:

```
$ ./buildAndRun.sh
```
